# Processing of order 1868 (MiSeq 2X250) 12/08/22

## Preparation of Libraries

- Libraries prepared using standard 16S amplicon library preparation protocol

- Library Concentration by Qubit:
    1. Plate 1 pool: 22.3ng/ul
    2. Plate 2 pool: 8.00ng/ul

- Size determined on Bioanalyzer 400bp for each library pool.

- Library Dilution
    Libraries were diluted 1:22 and 1:8 for plate 1 and plate 2, respectively, to get to a final concentration of 4nM.
      - Concentration for plate 1 dilution measured at 0.774ng/ul or a molar concentration of 2.9nM.
      - Concentration for plate 2 dilution measured at 0.862ng/ul or a molar concentration of 3.3nM.
      `concentrations were off somewhat possibly initial Qubit measurement of the library plate pools was incorrect`.

    Diluted library plate pools were combined at a ratio of 10ul plate 1 + 5ul plate2.  Concentration as measured on Qubit was 0.810ng/ul or 3nM.  The final pool was diluted to 2nm by adding 7ul of EB buffer to the final pool.  Concentration of the final pool was confirmed to be 2nM on the Qubit.

## Sequencing of libraries on the Illumina MiSeq

- Initial MiSeq set up
    The MiSeq flowcell was cleaned and inserted into the sequencer.
    The running buffer and empty waste container were put on the instrument.

- Preparation of the sequencing sample
